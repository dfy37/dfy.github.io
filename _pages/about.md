I'm a third year graduate student from Beihang University. My research interest includes natural language processing, machine learning, and LLM.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wenge Rong](https://wgrong.github.io/) from [School of Computer Science](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/), Beihang University.
